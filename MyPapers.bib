abstract = {The objective of this work is to evaluate the persistence of inter-annual meteorological droughts and to characterize them both spatially and temporally in levels of severity for the Brazilian Septentrional Northeast (NSB). Commonly used tools are the Palmer index, the Palmer drought severity index, and the normalized precipitation index. For this study the normalized precipitation index was utilized. Temporal analysis reveals that as time passes, drought severity is increasing and have reached increasing meteorological seasons. This analysis demonstrates the necessity to develop an effective drought management plan for use not only during the most severe droughts but throughout the entire year.},

@inproceedings{Doss-Gollin2014a,
abstract = {During the past two decades, government and NGO efforts to provide water access to rural communities in Brazil’s semi-arid regions have focused on rainwater capture and cistern storage. The heterogeneous climate in this region causes significant spatial variations in the effectiveness of this strategy. In addition, factors such as the size of the area of capitation, the run-off coefficient of the roofs, and the amount of first flush diversion also have important effects. This article presents an analytical model based on these factors to evaluate the hydraulic sustainability of rainwater cisterns in Brazil’s semi-arid northeast. Analysis reveals that while rainwater capture can provide sustainable water access in some areas, it cannot guarantee universal access to drinking water, particularly for households with small areas of capture or households in the most drought- prone regions of the state.},

@article{Doss-Gollin2015,
abstract = {During the past two decades, government and NGO efforts to provide water access to rural communities in Brazil’ s semi-arid Northeast region have focused on building systems to capture and store rainwater, culminating in the One Million Cisterns Program (P1MC). This article presents an analytical model based on measured 30-year precipitation data to evaluate the hydraulic sustainability of rainwater capture with global applicability. Analysis of the P1MC reveals that the heterogeneous climate in this region causes significant spatial variations in the effectiveness of this strategy. In addition, the size of the area of capture, the run-off coefficient of the roofs, and the amount of first-flush diversion also have important effects. This analysis demonstrates that while rainwater capture can offer sufficient water for drinking, as a stand-alone solution cannot meet P1MC objectives of guaranteeing sustainable and universal access to water for both drinking and cooking uses in Northeast Brazil, particularly for households with small areas of capture and households in the most drought-prone regions.},
