  abstract = {During the past two decades, government and NGO efforts to provide water access to rural communities in Brazil's semi-arid regions have focused on rainwater capture and cistern storage. The heterogeneous climate in this region causes significant spatial variations in the effectiveness of this strategy. In addition, factors such as the size of the area of capitation, the run-off coefficient of the roofs, and the amount of first flush diversion also have important effects. This article presents an analytical model based on these factors to evaluate the hydraulic sustainability of rainwater cisterns in Brazil's semi-arid northeast. Analysis reveals that while rainwater capture can provide sustainable water access in some areas, it cannot guarantee universal access to drinking water, particularly for households with small areas of capture or households in the most drought- prone regions of the state.},

  abstract = {During the austral summer 2015-16, severe flooding displaced over 170000 people on the Paraguay River system in Paraguay, Argentina, and Southern Brazil. These floods were driven by repeated heavy rainfall events in the Lower Paraguay River Basin. Alternating sequences of enhanced moisture inflow from the South American Low-Level Jet and local convergence associated with baroclinic systems were conducive to mesoscale convective activity and enhanced precipitation. These circulation patterns were favored by cross-timescale interactions of a very strong El Niño event, an unusually persistent Madden-Julian Oscillation in phases four and five, and the presence of a dipolar SST anomaly in the central southern Atlantic Ocean. The simultaneous use of seasonal and sub-seasonal heavy rainfall predictions could have provided decision makers useful information about the start of these flooding events from at least two-to-four weeks in advance. Probabilistic seasonal forecasts available at the beginning of November successfully indicated heightened probability of heavy rainfall (90th percentile) over southern Paraguay and Brazil for December-February. Raw sub-seasonal forecasts of heavy rainfall exhibited limited skill at lead times beyond the first two predicted weeks, but a Model Output Statistics approach involving principal component regression substantially improved the spatial distribution of skill for Week 3 relative to other methods tested including extended logistic regressions. A continuous monitoring of climate drivers impacting rainfall in the region, and the use of bias-corrected heavy precipitation seasonal and sub-seasonal forecasts, may help improve flood preparedness for the austral summer season in this part of the world.},

  title = {Designing and Operating Infrastructure for Nonstationary Flood Risk Management},
  abstract = {Climate exhibits organized low-frequency and regime-like variability at multiple time scales, causing the risk associated with climate extremes such as floods and droughts to vary in time. Despite broad recognition of this nonstationarity, there has been little theoretical development of ideas for the design and operation of infrastructure considering the regime structure of such changes and their potential predictability. We use paleo streamflow reconstructions to illustrate an approach to the design and operation of infrastructure to address nonstationary flood and drought risk. Specifically, we consider the tradeoff between flood control and conservation storage, and develop design and operation principles for allocating these storage volumes considering both a m-year project planning period and a n-year historical sampling record. As n increases, the potential uncertainty in probabilistic estimates of the return periods associated with the T-year extreme event decreases. As the duration m of the future operation period decreases, the uncertainty associated with the occurrence of the T-year event also increases. Finally, given the quasi-periodic nature of the system it may be possible to offer probabilistic predictions of the conditions in the m-year future period, especially if m is small. In the context of such predictions, one can consider that a m-year prediction may have lower bias, but higher variance, than would be associated with using a stationary estimate from the preceding n years. This bias-variance trade-off, and the potential for considering risk management for multiple values of m, provides an interesting system design challenge. We use wavelet-based simulation models in a Bayesian framework to estimate these biases and uncertainty distributions and devise a risk-optimized decision rule for the allocation of flood and conservation storage. The associated theoretical development also provides a methodology for the sizing of storage for new infrastructure under nonstationarity, and an examination of risk adaptation measures which consider both short term and long term options simultaneously.},
