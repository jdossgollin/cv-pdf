# My Resume

I am currently trying to switch to an online-only CV, available at https://jamesdossgollin.me/online-cv/.
However, lots of places require PDF CVs, so I am continuing to maintain this one as well.
The repository is set to *private so that my cover letters are not made public* and this should not be changed.
