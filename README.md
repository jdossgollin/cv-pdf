# fullcv

This is the source files for my CV, built in latex using the `moderncv` template and `biblatex` (via `biber`). 
The code isn't beautifully written, but it's effective for what it does.

Use without attributing anything to me since I didn't write any packages -- I just hacked some things together and sought help on StackOverflow. Thanks to the authors of the packages.
