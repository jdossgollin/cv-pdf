# fullcv

This is the source files for my CV, built in latex using the `moderncv` template and `biblatex` (via `biber`) for bibliographies. 
The code isn't beautifully written, but it's effective for what it does.
Thanks to the `LaTeX` package authors, Stack Exchange posts, etc.

## Note

Move `CV_Doss-Gollin_James.pdf` to `docs/CV_Doss-Gollin_James.pdf` when it's a final version suitable for my web site.
