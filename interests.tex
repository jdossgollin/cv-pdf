%I'm a Ph.D. student at the \href{http://water.columbia.edu}{Columbia Water Center} studying statistical and physical approaches to modeling hydroclimatological extremes.
%I'm particularly interested in understanding the drivers of extreme rainfall and how to use knowledge of those drivers for statistical-physical modeling.
%I thus seek to bridge theory from atmospheric dynamics and meteorology with statistical machine learning and dimension reduction techniques.
